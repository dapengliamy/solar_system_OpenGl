I create an animated 3D scene with texture of the solar system that is faithful in certain aspects.

To retain enough accuracy in the 3D simulation:
1. Use spheres proportional to the sizes of the planets. 
2. Use different texture for each planet.
3. Draw the most salient satellites such as the Moon and the circle of moonlets for Saturn. 
4. Animation should show the accurate orbiting movements of the planets as well as the satellites.
5. Should support change of view angle and zoom in/zoom out.
6. The lighting should be as accurate as possible: those half spheres facing the sun should be lighted, and the other halves should be dark.
